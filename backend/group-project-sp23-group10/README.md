# 253BFinalProject
<br>
This work was completed as part of a group project for INFO 253B Backend Web Architecture. The code was created in collaboration with Sathvik Kolli, Grace Roseman, Sihang Liu, Pranjal Sinha and myself. I functioned in the split role of project manager with Grace Roseman, in addition to building the 'news' module, debugging the 'streetview' module and helping to debug and format the main site.
