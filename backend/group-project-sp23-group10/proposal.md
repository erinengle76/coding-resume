# 253B Final Project Proposal ~ Group 10 #
## **Team Members:** Erin Jones, Sathvik Kolli, Sihang Liu, Grace Roseman, Pranjal Sinha ##

**Proposed Idea:**

*Our team would like to build an API that supports the following functionality:*
- A user registration page, which allows users to register their information to be stored in a database; information will include preferences which impact content when logged in later. This page will send users a confirmation email once they have successfully registered
- A user login page, which allows registered users to login 
- A user home page which will display external information based on their registration preferences. Our team is currently bouncing around ideas about what content will be displayed -- if it is not too complex to implement, we may support multiple content types (news, finance data, horoscope, restaurants) depending on what preference they indicate in the registration phase (e.g. if user indicates they are interested in finance, we will use the NASDAQ API to display current stock information; if the user indicates a preference for astrology, we will use an available horoscope API to display horoscope information)

**Desired feedback:**
- Please let us know if the above will be entirely too complex to complete in the given timeframe.
