The singular route defined below is designed to respond to user requests from the terminal_chatbot.py program. Data is pulled from the request body when a POST call is made within the "/message" route. The message passed by the user is parsed, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. After removing whitespace, if a message starts with "/" the command is split into two, based on the first whitespace following the "/" - the word attached to the slash is assigned to the command and the rest is assigned to the message using indexing and then both the message and command are passed back in JSON format.

If the message does not contain a leading "/", then the command is automatically assigned None and the message is assigned to the message variable as is. Both the message and command variables are then passed back in JSON format.
